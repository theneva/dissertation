# Thesis

This is the main repository for the written part of my Master's thesis due spring 2016.

## Installing and executing

When setting up the project, run the following commands:

```shell
$ npm install
```

```shell
$ npm run preinstall
```

```shell
$ brew install pandoc
```

```shell
$ pip install pandoc-fignos
```

```shell
$ brew install pandoc-citeproc
```

```shell
$ npm run build
```

When you've made any changes, re-run:
```shell
$ npm run build
```

Output is in [./build](./build).
