There are many strategies for automating deployment in a microservice context, a time-consuming and often error-prone task. The study aims to create a framework for comparing different strategies and performing a comparison of some popular choices.

I propose triangulating two research strategies: a preliminary case study at FINN.no to establish relevance for the industry, and a design \& creation project to improve the framework. The case study report, the analysis framework, and the actual comparison will be the key artefacts produced from the study and presented in the Master thesis.
