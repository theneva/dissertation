## 1 Background

- The study undertaken by the interviewer, Martin Lehmann, is part of the data foundation for his Master thesis.
- The thesis will be submitted to Westerdals Oslo School of Arts, Communication and Technology, for the Applied Computer Science programme.
- The key aim of the thesis is to develop a way to efficiently analyse and compare different approaches to implementing automated deployment in a microservice context.
- This interview is part of a series of interviews whose goal is to identify the current efforts being made to automate deployment in a microservice context.
- Relevant information from the interview will be used---together with a review of the existing literature on the subject---to build a framework for analysing and comparing different strategies and approaches to automating deployment in a microservice context.
- Data gathered from the interview may also be used to build an implementation of a deployment pipeline similar to the one FINN is committing to at the time of the interview, which will in turn be used to validate the framework.
