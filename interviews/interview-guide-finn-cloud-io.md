# Interview guide for the containerisation initiative

## Background for the interview

- Interviewee: Audun Fauchald Strand, Lead Developer in Infrastructure @ Finn.no
- Date: January 22nd 206 1pm--2pm
- Location: FINN.no's offices at Grensen 5--7.

This interview is intended to uncover why FINN.no has committed to containerisation with Docker across the entire organisation and how this was prioritised.

This is important because it will help uncover the status quo of efforts being made regarding deployment automation in a microservice context.

I already know that efforts are being made to implement Docker across the entire organisation. I also know that the strategy (people-focused) has not been finalised or seen implementation yet, but that it is coming in the next few days. I will conduct a new interview with another member of the Cloud-IO team to get another perspective and look into how the containerisation is actually being implemented and adopted by the teams.
