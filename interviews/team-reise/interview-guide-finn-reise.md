# Interview guide for FINN reise

## Background for the interview

- Interviewee: Stig Kleppe-JÃ¸rgensen, team lead for Team Reise at FINN.no
- Date: January 22nd 2016 10am--11am
- Location: FINN.no's offices at Grensen 5--7.

This interview is intended to uncover how Team Reise, a team that does _not_ use containers, handles automated packaging, testing, deployment, and code review.

This is important because it will shed light on another side of the containerisation initiative: this team has managed to automate extensively without containers.

I know close to nothing about the team, other than that it consisted of 16 developers split into 4 teams of 4 people, and that the team prioritised automation above all else.
