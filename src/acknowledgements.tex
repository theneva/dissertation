\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisor, Frode Eika Sandnes, for his invaluable guidance, input, and faith in this project.

A big thank you goes out to FINN.no for hosting my case study. In particular, Audun Fauchald Strand, Eirik Sletteberg, and Stig Kleppe-Jørgensen for taking the time to engage in interesting discussions and providing  valuable input.

I am grateful to everyone who have helped lift the quality of the thesis and my life in general: Kim Johansen Østby, Arne Christian Blystad, Simen Bekkhus, Vegard Strand, and Liam Eloie.

Thank you to my parents, who have supported me all the way up to this milestone in my life.

Last, but not least, I want to thank my partner in life, Rebecca Soraya Gjerstad, for her encouragement and love.
