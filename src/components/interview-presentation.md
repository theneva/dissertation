### Motivation for a case study

@yin:2014 suggests three classes of case study: _exploratory_, used to seek questions that require researching; _descriptive_, helpful in analysing a phenomenon in its natural context; and _explanatory_, seeking to both identify events and explain _why_ they occurred.

The work of establishing a set of characteristics that are important in a Automated Continuous Delivery (ACD) strategy is largely a _descriptive_ study, although it bears some _exploratory_ characteristics: the study might reveal connections to other, interesting areas, but the phenomenon under study is already largely defined. It is not of any particular interest to the research questions _why_ the organisation is in its current position.

### Selecting a case: FINN.no

FINN.no is Norway's leading actor in the online classified ads market, with several hundred thousand visitors unique visitors per week^[http://www.tnslistene.no/?list_id=1&week=16&year=2016&report=day&metric=historic]. FINN.no was an early adopter of the microservice pattern, and currently have more than 300 microservices. At the time of writing, they are currently in the process of migrating their entire platform to a uniform Deployment Strategy. This makes them an highly relevant case to study, and so two interviews were conducted to learn about what they, representing the industry as a whole, deem important in a Deployment Strategy. The following two of FINN's teams are of particular interest.

Team Cloud IO is responsible for maintaining and developing the infrastructure at FINN, and plays a large part in the initiative to migrate the entire organisation to containers. Team Cloud IO loosely defined the requirements for an organisation-wide uniform Deployment Automation strategy, and carries out the work of helping teams migrate their services to containers.

Team Reise was initially formed to rewrite the existing platform for the travel marketplace on FINN.no. As part of this process, the team focused on automating deployment as much as possible within the bounds set by the company's infrastructure. This resulted in Team Reise being the most automated platform, and thus the largest authority on experiences with Automated Deployment.


### Scoping the study to interviews

TODO: Why was the study scoped to only include interviews?

### Interview design

TODO: Describe how the interviews were carried out:

- Initial meeting with Team Cloud IO to find interesting teams and topics
- One on one, approximately one hour
- Semi-structured interviews [@oates:2006, pp.187--188]
