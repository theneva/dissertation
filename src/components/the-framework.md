## The final framework

This section has discussed several important aspects to consider when building and deploying applications in a microservice context. In conclusion of this section, (TODO table 1) presents the first part of the main artefact: a set of important criteria to consider when selecting a deployment strategy for a specific scenario, along with brief descriptions. The rest of the thesis describes the implementation of a reference case, and uses the framework to evaluate some popular deployment strategies. The entire thesis concludes with a final set of requirements uncovered from both this discussion and the implementation work.
