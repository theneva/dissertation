# Discussion: establishing a final framework

The background chapter concluded with an important set of criteria identified in the current literature. Similarly, the results chapter presented a set of important criteria identified through the case study. These criteria were combined and used to evaluate the reference application _BeerFave_, which both demonstrated how the framework can be used, and brought up some important observations. This chapter combines the results from the study, and concludes with a final version of the framework for evaluating and comparing different strategies for Automated Continuous Delivery.
