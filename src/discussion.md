# Discussion: establishing a final framework

The background chapter concluded with an important set of criteria identified in the current literature. Similarly, the results chapter presented a set of important criteria identified through the case study. These criteria were combined and used to evaluate the reference application _BeerFave_, which both demonstrated how the framework can be used, and brought up some important observations. This chapter maps the results from the literature review to those from the case study, accounts for the implementation project, and concludes with a final version of the framework.
