# Glossary

- __Autonomous__: (Of a service) independently able to run and control itself, typically by managing its own interface, specialised logic, and (if required) database.
- __Blue/Green Deployment__: Deployment of new code changes to only some production servers, in order to avoid downtime even if something goes wrong.
- __Canary Release__: Deployment of new changes to a fraction of the end users.
- __CAP Theorem__: A theorem defined by Eric Brewer stating that it is impossible for a system to simultaneously provide _Consistency_, _Availability_, and _Partition tolerance_.
- __Continuous Delivery__ (CD): The combination of __Continuous Integration__ and __Continuous Deployment__ into a process where changes are delivered to the end users as soon as they are ready.
- __Continuous Deployment__: The process of deploying new changes to the production environment as soon as they are integrated into the mainline.
- __Continuous Integration__ (CI): The process of frequently merging code changes into the production-ready code base, or "mainline" (for example the _master_ branch in Git).
