# Introduction

Service-based comptuting (and variants commonly referred to as "microservices" and "service-oriented architecture") and Continuous Deployment (CD) have both gained great traction in the development community with the rise of Cloud computing and the _as a Service_ trend. Numerous conferences and magazines around the world, such as SciTePress's International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER)[^closer] and IEEE Cloud Computing[^ieee-cc] and all its conferences[^ieee-cloud-conferences], and the themes are to be found at most popular conferences on software engineering, development, and operations.

This thesis will answer the following two research questions:

```

TODO: What else do I "give away" in the introduction? Do I say anything about the method?

The remainder of the thesis is split into five chapters.

First, the __Background__ chapter presents a literature review that explores and discusses some areas relevant to Automated Continuous Deployment (ACD) in a microservice context.

Next, the __Method__ chapter presents the means used to answer the research questions. It argues for using Design Science Research [@hevner:dsr:2004] as a methodology for the project, and presents the design of the data generation methods and the software system built to evaluate the findings. It concludes by discussing some advantages and disadvantages of the selected research design.

The findings from the data generation methods are presented in the __Results__ chapter.

The results are evaluated and discussed in the _Discussion_ chapter, which concludes with the final iteration of the artefact.

Finally, the __Conclusion__ chapter summarises the work, distils the results, and suggests areas of future research.
