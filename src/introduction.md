Service-based comptuting (and variants commonly referred to as "microservices" and "service-oriented architecture") and Continuous Deployment (CD) have both gained great traction in the development community with the rise of Cloud computing and the _as a Service_ trend. Numerous conferences and magazines around the world, such as SciTePress's International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER)[^closer] and IEEE Cloud Computing[^ieee-cc] and all its conferences[^ieee-cloud-conferences], and the themes are to be found at most popular conferences on software engineering, development, and operations.
