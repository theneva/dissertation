| Guideline | Description | In this thesis
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------
| 1: Design as an Artifact | Design-science research must produce a viable artifact in the form of a construct, a model, a method, or an instantiation. | A framework---_method_---for evaluating strategies for ACD is produced.
| 2: Problem Relevance | The objective of design-science research is to develop technology-based solutions to important and relevant business problems. | Business relevance is established in the literature review, as well as through interviews with FINN.no.
| 3: Design Evaluation | The utility, quality, and efficacy of a design artifact must be rigorously demonstrated via well-executed evaluation methods | The developed comparison framework is iteratively tested by being used to evaluate multiple popular strategies for ACD.
| 4: Research Contributions | Effective design-science research must provide clear and verifiable contributions in the areas of the design artifact, design foundations, and/or design methodologies. | No equivalent technique or framework for comparing strategies ASRs were discovered in the literature review.
| 5: Research Rigor | Design-science research relies upon the application of rigorous methods in both the construction and evaluation of the design artifact. | The initial definition of criteria draws upon the current literature and interviews. The evaluation uses a Design and Creation [@oates:2006] project.
| 6: Design as a Search Process | The search for an effective artifact requires utilizing available means to reach desired ends while satisfying laws in the problem environment. | The search uses interviews and the existing literature to gather an initial set of criteria, and multiple strategies are implemented to further explore the framework's applicability.
| 7: Communication of Research | Design-science research must be presented effectively both to technology-oriented as well as management-oriented audiences. | The research outcome is presented in this thesis.
