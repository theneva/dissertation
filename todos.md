TODO: The Framework can possibly be visualised better than using the silly table:

- http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi (academic, don't necessarily spend a lot of time)
- http://www.amazon.com/Show-Me-Numbers-Designing-Enlighten/dp/0970601999 (not academic, but good input)

TODO: Don't number the subsubsubsubsubsubsections.
