TODO: The Framework can possibly be visualised better than using the silly table:

- http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi (academic, don't necessarily spend a lot of time)
- http://www.amazon.com/Show-Me-Numbers-Designing-Enlighten/dp/0970601999 (not academic, but good input)

TODO: Don't number the subsubsubsubsubsubsections.

TODO: Add performance metrics (application startup time, request response time) in background chapter

TODO: Mention that Deis (while extremely helpful) can only be run inside CoreOS, which can be limiting in some cases

TODO: mention LeverOS

TODO: mention Dockercraft https://github.com/docker/dockercraft

TODO: Take a closer look at design science, or at least explain the characteristics of DSR and why it is a good match.

TODO: Replace all instances of the word "interesting"

TODO: Add src/components/stuff-from-establish-framework

TODO: consistently use "e.g." instead of "for example" or "such as" when listing things?

TODO: grep for "area" (replace with "theme"), and "section" (replace with "chapter")

TODO: "FINN" => "FINN.no"

TODO: "Horisontal" => "Horizontal"

TODO: "characteristic" or "criterion/a"? or "requirement(s)" or "capability/ies?
